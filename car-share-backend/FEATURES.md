# Car-Sharing Application: Detailed Explanation

## Core Application Flow

### 1. User Registration and Authentication Flow

**Step 1: User Registration**
1. New users register via `POST /auth/register` providing personal details (name, email, password, etc.)
2. System creates a new user account with status "pending"
3. System generates email and phone verification tokens
4. System sends verification OTP to user's email via `POST /auth/send-email-otp`

**Step 2: Email and Phone Verification**
1. User receives email with OTP code
2. User submits OTP via `POST /auth/verify-email-otp`
3. If verified, `isEmailVerified` is set to true
4. Similarly, user can verify phone number via `POST /auth/send-phone-otp` and `POST /auth/verify-phone-otp`
5. User can check verification status via `GET /auth/verification-status`

**Step 3: User Login**
1. User logs in via `POST /auth/login` with email and password
2. System validates credentials and returns access token and refresh token
3. Access token is used for subsequent API calls
4. When token expires, user can get a new one via `POST /auth/refresh-token`
5. User can logout via `POST /auth/logout` which blacklists the current token

### 2. User Profile Management Flow

**Step 1: View Profile**
1. Authenticated user can view their profile via `GET /users/profile`
2. Profile includes personal details, verification status, ratings, etc.

**Step 2: Update Profile**
1. User can update profile via `PATCH /users/profile`
2. Updates can include name, phone, avatar, date of birth, address, etc.

**Step 3: Become a Driver (Role Upgrade)**
1. Regular user can apply to become a driver via `POST /users/driver`
2. User provides vehicle details and driver's license information
3. System creates a new vehicle record associated with the user
4. Admin reviews and approves driver application (status changes from "pending" to "active")

### 3. Trip Creation and Management Flow (Driver Perspective)

**Step 1: Create a Trip**
1. Driver creates a trip via `POST /trips`
2. Driver specifies vehicle, start/end locations, start/end times, available seats, price per seat, etc.
3. System validates input and creates a new trip with status "scheduled"
4. Trip becomes visible to potential passengers

**Step 2: Manage Trip**
1. Driver can view all their trips via `GET /trips`
2. Driver can view specific trip details via `GET /trips/:id`
3. Driver can update trip details via `PATCH /trips/:id` (if no bookings yet)
4. Driver can cancel trip via `PATCH /trips/:id` with status update to "cancelled"

**Step 3: Trip Execution**
1. When trip starts, driver updates status to "in_progress" via `PATCH /trips/:id`
2. Driver can communicate with passengers via chat (`POST /chat/:tripId`)
3. Driver's location is shared in real-time via websocket (`trip_update` event)
4. When trip ends, driver updates status to "completed"
5. Driver can rate passengers via `PATCH /bookings/:id/rate`

### 4. Trip Booking Flow (Passenger Perspective)

**Step 1: Find Trips**
1. Passenger searches for available trips via `GET /trips` with filters (location, time, seats needed)
2. System returns matching trips with available seats

**Step 2: Book a Trip**
1. Passenger books seats on a trip via `POST /bookings`
2. Passenger specifies number of seats, pickup/dropoff locations, etc.
3. System calculates total price and creates booking with status "pending"
4. System creates payment intent via `POST /payments/create-payment-intent`

**Step 3: Payment Process**
1. Passenger completes payment using Stripe
2. System updates booking status to "confirmed" and payment status to "paid"
3. Driver is notified of new booking

**Step 4: Trip Experience**
1. Passenger can view booking details via `GET /bookings/:id`
2. Passenger can communicate with driver via chat (`POST /chat/:tripId`)
3. Passenger receives real-time trip updates via websocket
4. After trip completion, passenger can rate driver via `PATCH /bookings/:id/rate`

### 5. Payment and Financial Flow

**Step 1: Payment Collection**
1. When passenger books a trip, system creates payment intent via Stripe
2. Passenger completes payment, funds are held by platform
3. System records payment with status "authorized"

**Step 2: Payment Distribution**
1. After trip completion, system transfers funds to driver (minus platform fee)
2. System updates payment status to "completed"
3. Driver's earnings are updated

**Step 3: Refunds and Cancellations**
1. If passenger cancels before trip, refund is processed based on cancellation policy
2. If driver cancels, full refund is processed
3. System updates payment status to "refunded"

### 6. Review and Rating System

**Step 1: Post-Trip Reviews**
1. After trip completion, both driver and passenger can submit reviews
2. Reviews include rating (1-5) and optional comments
3. System updates user ratings based on new reviews

**Step 2: View Reviews**
1. Users can view their reviews via `GET /reviews/user/:userId`
2. Trip reviews can be viewed via `GET /reviews/trip/:tripId`
3. Ratings affect user visibility and trust in the platform
